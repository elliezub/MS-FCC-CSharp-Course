exceptions:
In C#, errors in the program at runtime are propagated through the program by 
using a mechanism called exceptions. Exceptions are thrown by code that encounters 
an error and caught by code that can correct the error. Exceptions can be thrown 
by the .NET runtime or by code in a program. Exceptions are represented by classes 
derived from Exception. Each class identifies the type of exception and contains 
properties that have details about the exception.

The C# debugger for Visual Studio Code also supports Hit Count breakpoints 
and Logpoints.

A 'hit count' breakpoint can be used to specify the number of times that 
a breakpoint must be encountered before it will 'break' execution. You 
can specify a hit count value when creating a new breakpoint (with the Add 
Conditional Breakpoint action) or when modifying an existing one (with the 
Edit Condition action). In both cases, an inline text box with a dropdown 
menu opens where you can enter the hit count value.

A 'Logpoint' is a variant of a breakpoint that does not "break" into the 
debugger but instead logs a message to the console. Logpoints are especially 
useful for injecting logging while debugging production environments that cannot 
be paused or stopped. A Logpoint is represented by a "diamond" shaped icon 
rather than a filled circle. Log messages are plain text but can include 
expressions to be evaluated within curly braces ('{}').
